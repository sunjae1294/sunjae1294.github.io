<div style="text-align: justify;">
I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at <strong>Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU).</strong> I design and build next-generation computing systems that seamlessly integrate AI with human workflows and everyday interfaces.
<br><br>
My recent work spans: <strong>GUI &amp; Computer Use Agents</strong> that enable AI to autonomously navigate and interact with any software interface; <strong>Distributable User Interface systems</strong> for ubiquitous and context-aware mobile computing; and <strong>Human-AI-Computer Interaction (HACI)</strong> systems that redefine how humans and AI collaborate.
<br><br>
Currently, my team is synthesizing these directions to pioneer the foundation of a <strong>next-generation operating system</strong>—one where intelligent systems understand user intent, adapt interfaces across devices and contexts, and work in harmony with people in their everyday digital environments.
<br><br>
