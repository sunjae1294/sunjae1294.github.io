<div style="text-align: justify;">
I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at <strong>Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU).</strong> Prior to joining SKKU, I completed my PhD at KAIST, School of Computing, under the guidance of Professor Insik Shin.
<br>
<br>
My research lies at the intersection of <strong>mobile systems, artificial intelligence, and human-computer interaction.</strong> I am particularly interested in designing and building <strong>next-generation computing technologies</strong>, including mobile operating systems, Agentic AI systems for task automation (Computer-use agent), and novel Human-AI-Computer Interaction (HACI). If you are interested in learning more about my research or exploring potential collaborations, please feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:sunjae.lee@skku.edu"><strong>sunjae.lee@skku.edu</strong></a>.
